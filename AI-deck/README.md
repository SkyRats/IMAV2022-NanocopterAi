# AI-deck

- `pulp-dronet` contains PULP's original host repository for the PULP-DroNet convolutional neural network;
- `apps` contains `gapflow` and `app_imav_ai-deck`. GAPflow was the tool-set chosen for the deplyoment of the neural network.
    - `gapflow` contains instructions for compiling and deploying the neural network + gate detector to the AI-deck
    - `app_imav_ai-deck` contains the code for image processing and gate detection (image of gate bellow).
