# IMAV2022 Nanocopter AI Challenge


This repository is meant to house the development of a [crazyflie 2.x. challenge, for the 2022 IMAV competition](https://2022.imavs.org/index.php/competition/nanocopter-ai-challenge/). 

This repository is divided in two branches, one used for simulating the drone and AI using [webots](https://cyberbotics.com/#cyberbotics), and another used for the actual drone, and eventually the final code used in the competition.

## This is the simulation branch
